In recent years, the increasing prevalence and intensity of wildfires have posed significant challenges to emergency response teams. The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, has shown promise in aiding wildfire management efforts. This work focuses on the development of an optimal wildfire escape route planning system specifically designed for drones, considering dynamic fire and smoke models. First, the location of the source of the wildfire can be well located by information fusion between UAV and satellite, and the road conditions in the vicinity of the fire can be assessed and analyzed using multichannel remote sensing data. Second, the road network can be extracted and segmented in real time using UAV vision technology, and each road in the road network map can be given priority based on the results of road condition classification. Third, the spread model of dynamic fires calculates the new location of the fire source based on the fire intensity, wind speed and direction, and the radius increases as the wildfire spreads. Smoke is generated around the fire source to create a visual representation of a burning fire. Finally, based on the improved A* algorithm, which considers all the above factors, the UAV can quickly plan an escape route based on the starting and destination locations that avoid the location of the fire source and the area where it is spreading. By considering dynamic fire and smoke models, the proposed system enhances the safety and efficiency of drone operations in wildfire environments.
