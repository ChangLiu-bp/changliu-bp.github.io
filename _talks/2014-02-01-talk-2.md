This work presents an intelligent UAV-based route planning system for field environments. First, roads are extracted from real-time UAV images using D-LinkNet. Then, main and secondary roads are distinguished based on width and real-time road conditions, assigning different weights. Finally, a weighted A* algorithm calculates the optimal route between user-defined start and end points. The approach is validated through simulations on publicly available datasets and provides real-time optimal routes for people in the field.
