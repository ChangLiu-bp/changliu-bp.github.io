This talk presents a method for optimal wildfire escape route planning specifically for drones, considering dynamic fire and smoke models. The approach includes:

1. Locating wildfire sources using information fusion between UAV and satellite.
2. Assessing and analyzing road conditions near the fire using multichannel remote sensing data.
3. Extracting and segmenting the road network in real time using UAV vision technology, and assigning priorities to each road based on road condition classification.
4. Incorporating dynamic fire and smoke spread models to ensure safe and efficient escape routes for drones.
