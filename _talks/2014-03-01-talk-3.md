This work presents a UAV-based human gesture recognition system for rescue operations. The system can detect, track, and count humans, and recognize ten basic rescue gestures. Special attention is given to dynamic gestures Attention and Cancel, which set and reset communication with the UAV. Using deep learning, the system achieved 99.47% accuracy on training data and 99.09% accuracy on testing data.
